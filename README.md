# Stellar Todo — static front-end + serverless AI proxy

This repository contains a single-page, feature‑rich to‑do app (static) and an optional serverless proxy (`/api/ai.js`) for safe OpenAI integration.

## Features (front-end)
- Add tasks with title, description, due date, priority, tags, subtasks.
- LocalStorage persistence.
- Search, filter by priority, sort.
- Drag-and-drop reordering (simple HTML5 implementation).
- Export / Import JSON.
- Dark mode + keyboard shortcuts.
- AI Assistant hooks (works with direct key or with the serverless proxy).
